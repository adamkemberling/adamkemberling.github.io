About me:

I am a data scientist and marine researcher located in Portland, ME. My work currently centers on ecological responses to ocean warming, and I've been studying these responses through multi-species studies of both plankton and fish communities of the Northeastern US. I also lead the Gulf of Maine Warming Reports, including management of their remote-sensing data pipelines, as an effort to raise awareness through science communication.

I am an open science advocate, and I enjoy participating in projects where code-sharing and collaboration is encouraged. I am always looking to learn and collaborate with others. For those looking to connect you can reach me and find my work on [github](https://www.github.com/adamkemberling).


Cheers!
