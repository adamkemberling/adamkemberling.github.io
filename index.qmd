**About me:**

I am a data scientist and marine researcher located in Portland, ME. My work currently centers on ecological responses to ocean warming, and I've been studying these responses through multi-species studies of both plankton and fish communities of the Northeastern US. I also lead the [Gulf of Maine Warming Reports](https://www.gmri.org/stories/warming-22/), including management of their [remote-sensing data pipelines](www.github.com/adamkemberling/oisst_mainstays). These are efforts to raise awareness of cliamte change related impacts on the ocean environment through science communication.

I am an open science advocate, and I enjoy participating in projects where code-sharing and collaboration is encouraged. I am always looking to learn and collaborate with others and get involved with initiatives for social good. For those looking to connect you can reach me and find my work on [github](https://www.github.com/adamkemberling).


Cheers!
