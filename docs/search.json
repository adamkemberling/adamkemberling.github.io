I find myself more often leveraging the (near) decade of programming experiences to address big-data and statistical modeling questions.\nOn a more personal level, I am a lover of the outdoors and I enjoy taking the opportunities I have to spend time outdoors exploring Maine’s coastal and more mountainous regions with my family. I more recently have taken up running as an exercise/hobby, and this has helped me clear my head and get me out to see a different side of the place I live.\nThis site is a means for me to share some of the projects that have been impactful to my development as a professional data-scientist and as a person.It is my hope to share these experiences and highlight what I feel were some of the most interesting lessons, tips and tricks, and challenges encountered along the way.\nCheers!"

    "text": "Recent Focus: Ecological Responses to Ocean Warming\nMy research in New England has centered on how marine species and their ecological communities are responding to rapid ocean warming. Due in-part to shifts in major adjacent ocean currents, sea surface temperatures along the Northeast US & Nova Scotian continental shelf have been warming faster than most locations on Earth. This rapid-warming has attracted the attention of researchers, like myself, who wish to increase the understanding of how ecosystems respond to a changing environment."

The aim of this science-communication endeavor has been to raise awareness of changes in the regional ocean climate.\nThe coastal communities of New England and Canada (past and present) have rich cultural histories entwined with the local ecology. This work shines a light on how observed changes in the environment may influence marine species and the communities they support.\nOn my github you can find the code I use to maintain the processing steps for the OISSTv2 satellite SST data pipelines."

I employ these tools in my daily work (and in designing this website), and I am a stuanch believer in the open-science culture that has developed around their adoption in research. I am an open-science advocate, and I participating in projects where code-sharing and collaboration is encouraged. I am always looking to learn and collaborate with others and get involved with initiatives for social and environmental good.

However; I also believe it is important to be aware of what other avenues might exist. This workflow takes advantage of an environmental data distribution tool known as ERDDAP. This framework has API’s that interface with both python & R and I wanted to highlight how similar these interfaces R for researchers who might be looking for an example to show the paralells across the two languages.\n\nAccessing SST ovia ERDDAP\nIn this demo we will be using a data product made available by NOAA known as Optimally Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature or OISST. This resource contains global sea surface temperatures dating back to September of 1981.\n\nERDDAP Access Tools\nThe two main steps to accessing SST data, and other resources on ERDDAP are: 1. Locating the ERDDAP server and data resource 2. Using an api tool like rerddap or erdappy to generate URL’s for ERDDAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA work by Adam A.

I plan to share quick tutorials on ocean warming and marine ecology workflows, interspersed between pictures of my dog and my scattered thoughts about a career studying climate change.\nMy hope is that through these posts I can help early researchers find tips for some common workflow challenges, and raise awareness of how modern research and data science intersect. Learning to program in R/python has been an empowering experience for me, and allowed me to make things that I can be proud of, and tackle challenges I otherwise would have shyed away from. In the open-source spirit I wish to give back to the community so that others can share that experience… But also dog pictures too."
