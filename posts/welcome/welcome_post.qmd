This is my first blog post ever. Welcome!

Since this post doesn't specify an explicit `image`, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.

Since this is my first post, this is also not going to be too involved...

## Why am I doing this?

I've learned a ton about R and python from my peers. I see this as an opportunity to give back to the open-source community that has shaped my career.

```{r}
#| echo: false

gmRi::insert_gmri_footer("akemberling_gmri_footer.html")

```
