### Why am I doing this?

This site is for sharing my professional portfolio in a more detailed way, as well as for sharing some of the research and programming tricks that I've found useful in my career. I plan to share quick tutorials on ocean warming and marine ecology workflows, interspersed between pictures of my dog and my scattered thoughts about a career studying climate change.

My hope is that through these posts I can help early researchers find tips for some common workflow challenges, and raise awareness of how modern research and data science intersect. Learning to program in R/python has been an empowering experience for me, and allowed me to make things that I can be proud of, and tackle challenges I otherwise would have shyed away from. In the open-source spirit I wish to give back to the community so that others can share that experience... But also dog pictures too.
